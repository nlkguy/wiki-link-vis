Visualizing wikipedia page connections

## first link of every page.

- a poor implementation of a thing i saw in an amazon prime documentary  about data back in 2020
- at somepoint it showed the 'depth'? of data using an example where they recursively visited every first link of wikipedia articles.

## to-do
- find the documentary
- work with dash-cyto graph-s
